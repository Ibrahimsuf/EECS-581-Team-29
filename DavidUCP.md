User Story:
Making an easy and hard AI logic for the backend

Unadjusted Actor Weight (UAW):
Simple (adding the AI logic)
UAW = 1

Unadjusted Use Case Weight (UUCW):
Average (3 transactions)
UUCW = 10

Technical Complexity Factor (TCF):
End-user efficiency = 2
Ease of use = 2
TCF = 0.6+0.01×3=0.6+0.03=0.63

Environmental Factors (EF):
Familiarity = 3
Application experience = 3
Stable requirements = 5
Difficult language = 4
EF =1.4−0.03×12=1.4−0.36=1.04

Use Case Points (UCP):
Formula: UCP=(UAW+UUCW)×TCF×EF
UCP =11×0.6552≈7.21

Effort Estimate:
10 hours per UCP
7.21×10=72.1 hours

Estimated Time: 72.1 hours
Actual Time: 10 hours
